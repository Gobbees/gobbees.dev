Hello there, nice to e-meet you 👋

I'm Giovanni Gobbi, welcome to my personal space. I've opened this blog/website with the intent of sharing interesting things I learn or experience throughout my journey as a Software Engineer.
This can include technical deep dives related to something I built, an interesting observation I have regarding a paper or anything I feel passionate enough to share around.

As I've learnt more and more about the concept of [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), I've decided it is something I want to embrace going forward. I don't expect to be in any way consistent in posting here and I don't even expect to build a consistent audience but I hope this mechanism will keep myself accountable to continuously learn and experiment new things.

Work wise, I'm currently an Engineer at Amazon Prime Video working in the Living Room space, based in London. You can see my resume in the Resume tab (👷🏼‍♂️) or on <a href={siteMetadata.linkedin}>LinkedIn</a>. If you want to reach out to me, I'm most responsive on <a href={siteMetadata.twitter}>Twitter</a>.

All opinions are my own and are in no way related to my employer.

P.S. Why Gobbees? It's a nickname my friends in high school gave me and I guess I like it.
